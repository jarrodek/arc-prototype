Syntax highlighting via [Prism](http://prismjs.com/).

Place a `<prism-highlighter>` in your document, preferably as a direct child of
`<body>`. It will listen for `syntax-highlight` events on its parent element,
and annotate the code being provided via that event.

The `syntax-highlight` event's detail is expected to have a `code` property
containing the source to highlight. The event detail can optionally contain a
`lang` property, containing a string like `"html"`, `"js"`, etc.

This flow is supported by [`<marked-element>`](https://github.com/PolymerElements/marked-element).
